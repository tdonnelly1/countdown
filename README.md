With Transitions (sort of)
=========
Countdown Timer using a specified end date. 

The current configuration of the timer can be adjusted in the file on line 3  'ny.scriptv2.js'.

I am trying to figure out how to get transitions such as (fadeIn(); and fadeOut();) to work correctly 
currently at the 45 Minute / 30 Minute/ 15 Minute / and 0 Minute Mark, without constantly repeating everytime the function of Countdown is called. 

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
